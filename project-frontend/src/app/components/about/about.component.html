  <h1 class="display-3 mb-5">Login and Profile</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>When users register their passwords are confirmed as matching and complex. This new user is then checked in the backend
      to ensure no duplicate usernames or emails are registered</li>
    <li>Once registered users are prompted to login with their new credentials</li>
    <li>On login the username and a token are saved in local storage. This token is valid for 1 hour, after which time the user
      will need to log back in</li>
    <li>The profile is displayed as a list of current values from the database</li>
    <li>The interests are retrieved as an Object of boolean key pairs that are converted into an array and displayed as a string</li>
    <li>When user clicks edit a form is revealed that allows user to alter their profile and select new interests</li>

  </ul>
  <h1 class="display-3 mb-5">Voting</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>The voting portion of our website can be found in the user dropdown once logged in under Fundraising.</li>
    <li>There are 2 separate databases linked to this section</li>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a current voting database which allows users and admins to see what the current voting ideas status is</li>
      <li>There is also a New Idea database that allows users to suggest ideas for forthcoming events</li>
      <li>Both these databases have validation in the back end to ensure duplicate names and short names are not suggested</li>
    </ul>
    <li>In the user model the is an attribute 'isAdmin', this is only set to true by the users who run the site and can be manually
      adjusted in mLab only.</li>
    <li>As an admin the user has different options to the regular users</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Under Current Votes they can see the current tally of user votes and select a winner</li>
      <li>Below this section they have the ability to delete current voting options entirely</li>
      <li>They can also reset votes so the idea can be used again</li>
      <li>By selecting New Vote they can populate the Current Voting options with a brand new idea</li>
      <li>Alternatively they can browse suggested ideas below and either delete or edit them - editing pulls the details up into
        the form for submission</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Users have much less control over the databases</li>
    <ul>
      <li>They can vote for one of the current ideas suggested by the admins</li>
      <li>Once voted they get to see a graph of the current voting status</li>
      <li>They can also suggest a new idea for forthcoming events</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
